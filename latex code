\section*{1. Record Your Mood}
This program lets us keep a personal mood journal. We can enter your current mood on a scale from 1 to 10, write a title for the journal entry, and add any notes we like. It's like a diary for our feelings.

\section*{2. Never Lose Your Entries}
Our mood entries are stored using a user-friendly format called JSON. This means we won't lose your mood history even if we close the program. We can revisit and reflect on your past emotions.

\section*{3. Back Up Your Mood Data}
We can export your mood journal to a file. Think of it as creating a backup of our emotions. It's handy for saving your mood journal or sharing it with friends or therapists.

\section*{4. Bring Back the Past}
If we ever need to restore your previous mood entries or move them to another device, you can import your data from a JSON file.

\section*{5. Reflect on Your Journey}
The program allows us to view all your recorded mood entries. We'll see our journal titles, mood ratings, and any notes we've added. This feature is like a mirror to our past feelings.

\section*{6. Easy Navigation}
With a simple menu-driven interface, we can easily add, view, export, or import mood entries. It's designed to be user-friendly and straightforward.

\section*{7. No More Bad Ratings}
To make sure our mood ratings make sense, the program checks that they are between 1 and 10. This helps maintain the quality of our mood data.

\section*{8. Safety Net for Errors}
If something unexpected happens, don't worry. The program is prepared to handle issues when saving or loading our mood data. It's like a safety net for our emotions.

\section*{9. Code That Makes Sense}
The program's code is clean and organized. Variable and method names are chosen carefully to make it easy to understand and modify. Think of it as a well-organized bookshelf for your code.

\section*{10. Embrace Self-Discovery}
Beyond all the technical aspects, this program encourages self-reflection. It's a tool to better understand our moods and emotions over time. It helps you become more self-aware and gain insights into our feelings and experiences.
